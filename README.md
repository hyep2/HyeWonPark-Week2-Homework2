Project Name: Code Quiz

Objective: Create a multiple-choice, timed code quiz. It will feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


Description/Logic of App Development: The user can take the code quiz once he/she clicks on the start button which will make the quiz questions and answer choices appear subsequently. If user correctly answers question, he will gain 25 points. If user chooses the wrong question, he will be deducted 10 points. Also, another penalty is that the time is subtracted by 10 seconds from the clock. The game is over when user completes the quiz or time runs out. When game is over, user can save his initials and score, which can be viewed from clicking the 'view past scores' button. if the user wants to take the quiz again, he simply needs to press on the 'play again' button and the new score will be also added to the past score history. There will also be an option to clear the history.
